# SpotifyPlaylistToDiscord
Discord bot to convert a spotify link to a queue with youtube songs. It can play youtube songs, but I have not come around to finishing the spotify playlist conversion yet

To run: put jdk in the Plugins folder (or anywhere else on your machine)
Download Lavalink, for instructions, please follow Victoria's instructions: https://victoria.yucked.wtf/guides/getting-started/setup.html?tabs=tabid-lavagit%2Ctabid-ngt
Lavlink should be placed in Plugins\Lavalink
